"""Decide which scanned sides are blank, so a duplex scan of one-sided paper
does not produce a document that is half empty.

sane-backends already does this -- the fujitsu backend's `swskip` option, via
sanei_magic_isBlank2() -- but scanning over the network means none of that code
is in our path. This borrows its good idea and drops the part that does not
survive real ScanSnap output.

The good idea is that the test must be LOCAL. sanei_magic_isBlank2 splits the
page into half-inch blocks and keeps the page if any single block is dark
enough. A whole-page average dilutes a signature or a corner stamp into
nothing; a block test catches it.

Where it differs: SANE measures mean darkness, paper background included. On
real iX1500 scans the paper is not white, and that swamps the signal --

                        SANE block darkness        block ink fraction
                        max      median            max      median
    page with text    20.539%    4.447%          17.221%    0.000%
    blank reverse      7.885%    4.687%           0.000%    0.000%

The paper alone accounts for ~4.5% darkness on both, so the blank page's
darkest block outranks the text page's median. A threshold has to thread
between 7.9 and 20.5, and greyer paper closes the gap. Counting the fraction of
pixels that are actually ink removes the background term: a blank side measures
exactly zero.

Requires Pillow and numpy. Without them blank removal is skipped and every side
is kept, which is the safe direction.
