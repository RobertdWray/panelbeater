"""Enrol this machine in the scanner's host list.

The scanner keeps a list of hosts and shows their names on the panel. Until a
host is in that list it cannot register, and without a registration the panel's
Scan button stays dead.

Four things have to be right, and the failure for three of them is the same
unhelpful -2:

  * The document must carry conn_user AND profiles AND version. conn_user alone
    is accepted with status 0 and silently discarded.
  * The list is sent WHOLE. It is a replace, not an append, so the existing
    hosts have to be read first and passed back or they are dropped.
  * The write must sit inside a registration. Reads work unregistered, so this
    is easy to miss.
  * That registration must set intent 5 (see protocol.INTENT_CLAIM). With
    intent 0 the write is refused however correct the document is -- writing
    the list back byte-for-byte UNMODIFIED is refused too, so the -2 says
    nothing about the content.

Registration is refused -7 for any host_id the scanner has not enrolled, so a
machine that is not yet known cannot introduce itself directly. It registers as
a host the scanner does accept -- picked automatically from the existing list --
and adds itself. On a scanner with an empty list, its own id is accepted
straight away.

What CANNOT be set this way: `select` (which host the panel is pointed at) and
`profiles`. Those writes return 0 and are discarded -- they are scanner-managed.
Switch hosts by tapping the name on the panel itself.
