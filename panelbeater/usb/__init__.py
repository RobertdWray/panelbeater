"""Scanning over USB, without SANE.

The USB path needs no enrolment and no host_id: `SEND DIAGNOSTIC` has no
registration concept, so it works on a scanner straight out of the box. That
makes it the easier path to hand to somebody else, and the only one available
if the scanner is not on Wi-Fi.

It is also mutually exclusive with SANE, in both directions. Only one process
can claim the USB interface, so while panelbeater is running `scanimage` fails
at open with "Invalid argument", and vice versa. Scanning is therefore done
in-process rather than by shelling out to scanimage: handing the device over
for the duration of a scan means being blind to the Stop button, blind to
errors, and inferring "finished" from an exit code.
